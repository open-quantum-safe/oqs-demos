oqs-demos
=========

## Purpose

A repository of instructions (with associated patches and scripts) to enable, through [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs), the use of quantum-safe cryptography in various application software.

In most cases, Dockerfiles encode the instructions for ease-of-use: Just do `docker build -t <package_name> .`. For more detailed usage instructions (parameters, algorithms, etc.) refer to the README for each package.  Pre-built Docker images may also be available.

Currently supported packages:

|                  | **Build instructions**                 | **Pre-built Docker image or binary files**                                                                                   |
