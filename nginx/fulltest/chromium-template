<h1 align=center>Open Quantum Safe interop test server for quantum-safe cryptography</h1>
<h2> Purpose </h2>

<p>This server is an NGINX instance enhanced with support for quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) using software packages provided by the <a href="https://www.openquantumsafe.org">Open Quantum Safe project</a> (OQS).</p>

<p>In order to provide a means for clients to test interoperability with this QSC-enhanced software and the QSC algorithms contained it features separate ports for all QSC signature/key exchange algorithm combinations supported by the current OQS distribution. This page focuses on the algorithms supported by the OQS-enabled Chromium browser build.</p>

<h2> Specification details </h2>

<p>This nginx server supports</p>
<ul>
<li>the TLS1.3 specification with QSC enhancement as specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-06">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-06</a></li>
<li>Code points/curve IDs of KEM algorithms are implemented with the highest numbers available for each algorithm listed <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/ALGORITHMS.md">here</a>. </li>
<li>Code points/OIDs of SIG algorithms are implemented with the highest numbers available for each algorithm as listed <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/ALGORITHMS.md">here</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>This corresponds to the OQS release version LIBOQS_RELEASE and oqs-provider version OQSPROVIDER_RELEASE.</p>

<p>These specifications should not be taken as a standard, de facto and otherwise, and are subject to change at any time.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/tree/main/chromium">OQS-enabled Chromium build</a> to access this web page. As per the limitations concerning supported algorithms as documented <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/wiki/Implementation-Notes">here</a>, only the KEM algorithm combinations listed below will function (P256_BIKEL1, P256_FRODO640AES, P256_KYBER90S512, P256_NTRU_HPS2048509, P256_LIGHTSABER) and no hybrid signature algorithms are supported.

<p>More details are available at <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/wiki/Integrating-PQC-into-TLS-1.3">Github</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative view to <a href="index-base.html">all supported algorithms is available at this web page</a>.</p>

<h4> Caveats </h4>

<ol>
<li>This test server by no means should be taken as containing production-ready software. See <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs#limitations-and-security">disclaimer</a>. Its purpose is simply to provide a best-effort facility to allow anyone to "test-drive" QSC software packages including testing protocol level interoperability.</li>

</ol>

<h2> Certificates </h2>

<p>Each test port provides TLS server authentication using a server certificate generated using the listed QSC-signature algorithm. All server certificates are signed by a common CA certificate using conventional (RSA) cryptography. This certificate is available for download <a href="CA.crt">here</a>.</p>
