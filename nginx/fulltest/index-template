<h1 align=center>Open Quantum Safe interop test server for quantum-safe cryptography</h1>
<h2> Purpose </h2>

<p>This server is an NGINX instance enhanced with support for quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) using software packages provided by the <a href="https://www.openquantumsafe.org">Open Quantum Safe project</a> (OQS).</p>

<p>In order to provide a means for clients to test interoperability with this QSC-enhanced software and the QSC algorithms contained it features separate ports for all QSC signature/key exchange algorithm combinations supported by the current OQS distribution.</p>

<h2> Specification details </h2>

<p>This nginx server supports</p>
<ul>
<li>the TLS1.3 specification with QSC enhancement as specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-00</a></li>
<li>curve IDs, code-points, and OIDs as specified in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12YarzaNv3XQNLnvDsWLlRKwtZFhRrDdWf36YlzwrPeg/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These specifications should not be taken as a standard, de facto and otherwise, and are subject to change at any time.</p>

<p>More details are available at <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/wiki/Integrating-PQC-into-TLS-1.3">Github</a>.</p>

<h4> Caveats </h4>

<p>This test server by no means should be taken as containing production-ready software. See <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl#limitations-and-security">disclaimer</a>. Its purpose is simply to provide a best-effort facility to allow anyone to "test-drive" QSC software packages including testing protocol level interoperability.</p>

<h2> Certificates </h2>

<p>Each test port provides TLS server authentication using a server certificate generated using the listed QSC-signature algorithm. All server certificates are signed by a common CA certificate using conventional (RSA) cryptography. This certificate is available for download <a href="CA.crt">here</a>.</p>

<h2> Testing procedure </h2>

<p>While we cannot prescribe how this test infrastructure is used we can show how it can be utilized using the OQS software made available ready-build at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/openquantumsafe">Docker Hub</a> adding suggestions how other QSC-TLS implementations could check interoperability.</p>

<ol>
<li>If not already done, download the test CA certificate from <a href="CA.crt">here</a> to the directory you want to execute your tests from.</li>
<li>Select the algorithm combination to be tested from the list below. Assume this is <i>sig/kex (port)</i>.</li>
<li>Connect to the corresponding port with a QSC-enabled client side software, e.g., curl. Using a ready-made docker image this could be facilitated by running <br><pre>docker run -v `pwd`:/ca -it openquantumsafe/curl curl --cacert /ca/CA.crt https://test.openquantumsafe.org:<i>port</i> --curves <i>kex</i></pre>Be sure to insert the <i>port</i> and <i>kex</i> values chosen above.<br>The test will be successful if a web page indicating successful connection establishment (and display of the OQS algorithm combination configured as well as the client-supported key exchange mechanism) is received.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes: </p>
<ol>
<li>The instructions above assume a local installation of <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a>. </li>
<li><p>Another equally valid approach would be to build all required software from source and then execute it locally. Examples for this can be found in <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos">the OQS Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>In this way, you could for example verify correct operation of all components using openssl's <i>s_client</i> function by running <pre>echo "GET /" | openssl s_client -CAfile CA.crt --connect test.openquantumsafe.org:<i>port</i> --curves <i>kex</i></pre> Again, values for <i>port</i> and <i>kex</i> must be suitably set.</p></li>
<li>Using "openssl s_client" has the additional benefit that it also displays the actual algorithms utilized: <i>Server Temp Key</i> describes the key exchange algorithm and <i>Peer signature type</i> the signature algorithm actually used.</li>
<li>The OQS docker hub containers also provide a ready-made QSC-openssl distribution facilitating this test: You can do this for example with this command: <pre>docker run -v `pwd`:/ca -it openquantumsafe/curl openssl s_client --connect test.openquantumsafe.org:6000 -CAfile /ca/CA.crt </pre> Then issue the <tt>GET /</tt> command on the command line to retrieve an information page.</li>
<li>Using any algorithm with an 'oqs...default' name would necessitate client side software built with the exact same default algorithms set by the underlying OQS software. For details see <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/wiki/Using-liboqs-algorithms-not-in-the-fork">here</a>. Therefore interoperability testing against these algorithms may fail.</li>
