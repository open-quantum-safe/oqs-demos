# Deprecated demos

> [!Warning]
> Demos in this directory are longer supported, if you're interested in revitalizing a demo please submit a PR. 

Demos are considered deprecated when two factors are met, and can be un-deprecated by anyone willing to address them:

1. **Out of date or broken**: Either the demo is still based on the old oqs openssl1.1.1 fork rather than openssl3 using the oqs provider or it is not in a working state.
2. **No interest or expertise**: The community has shown no interest in updating or maintaining the demo

> **Note**: Demos that only meet factor 2 are considered Unmaintained, not Deprecated.
