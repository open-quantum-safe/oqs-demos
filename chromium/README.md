This directory contains instructions and corresponding patches to build the Chromium web browser using the [OQS-BoringSSL fork](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl), thereby enabling Chromium to use quantum-safe key exchange algorithms. Note that these instructions have been tested only on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18, 19, and 20 (x86_64) installations and apply at present only to a subset of quantum-safe key-exchanges as [documented here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl#key-exchange).
